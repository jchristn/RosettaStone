# RosettaStone

Rosetta Stone is an application that provides a centralized repository of metadata about vendors and CODECs involved in the creation of DNA data storage archives.  With Rosetta Stone, an archive reader could amplify and sequence what is known as "sector 0" to discern lookup values that, when presented to this application, returns to the user metadata about the vendor that wrote the archive and the CODEC used to write sector 1.
